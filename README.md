# SnapPark

This is my implementation of the RideCell coding challenge.  

The challenge was, in short, to create a parking reservation app which attaches
to a RESTful server.  

My implementation of the challenge allows you to preview the neighborhood where the parking spot resides and tells you how far away it is from your current location.

You must have a Google Api Key to run this code.  To get one, assuming you already have an account, follow these directions:

######Create a Browser Key:
1. Go to the API Manager:  https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library?project=alert-aria-136521
2. Click "Credentials" (on the left)
3. Click "Create Crendentials"
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Click "Browser Key"
6. Configure Key
   * You may need to set the key to allow your domain.
7. Click "Create"

######Enable Map API acesss:

Voila.
